# yelp-camp-codealong
Final Project of Colt Steele's WebDev Bootcamp from Udemy

**What's the project's function?**


**What's the purpose?**
The purpose of Yelp Camp is to use many of the skills taught in the WebDev Bootcamp by Colt Steele found on Udemy. It serves to make a larger project, see the development from start to finish, and point out common points of interest such as error-handling, data validation (both front-end and in the database), routes and cookies, Flash, basic authorization, image upload, adding maps, security issues, and deployment.

**Who's it for?**
The project is mostly for me, Joe Gerhardt, for practice, a good roadmap to refer when starting a new project, and others to evaluate my work. It can also be viewed by students to see how part of my project was coded, or how implementations can differ from one person to another even in a code-along.

**How to run Yelp Camp?**


**How to get help or more info?**
If you need help coding this project outside of Udemy, consult with the discord found through the course. If you need to get in touch with me, use joe.gits.it@gmail.com
